# WeatherApp
Weather notification project
Just a basic weather notification with the local weather in my area.

Pulls from the national weather service api and displays a windows notification of the current weather, with a button that says 'Tonight' to view tonights weather.
As well as a simple close button to close the notification, its set on a loop to run every 2 hours to keep you updated on the current weather.
